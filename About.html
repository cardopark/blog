<h2>Why I start my own blog</h2>
<p>
I started this blog for three reasons.
<p>
1. I want to share my contents globally.
<br>
2. I want to improve my writing and practice English.
<br>
3. I want to learn basic HTML codes to build my own online space.

<h2>My side-hustles</h2>
<P>
I believe that a person is defined by their behavior, not their state.
<br>
Therefore, I'm going to introduce what I'm doing.
<p>
<b>Writing</b>
<p>
I'm a book-warm. I love reading any kinds of text contents such as books, magazines, blogs and even labes on prodcuts.This love for text contents made me a writer naturally. I'm writing something always such as my journal, essyas, or novels. 
<p>
My writing goal aims to make people more funny, impressive, or meaningful.
<p> 
<b>Investing</b>
<p>
I'm saving money to invest in stocks of mainly Korean or American companies. I want to accomplish the <a href=<"https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+fire+stands+for">'F.I.R.E'.</a> However, I love studying various businesses and macro issues. I'm trying to enjoy my investing journey rather than obsess with money.
<p>
<b>Traveling</b>
<p>
I love traveling all over the world. I visited 18 countries so far. I want to visit much more.
<p>
I like to have very new insights from my travels. I write about it. Also, I like comparing different cultures and am open to having different views. Ultimately, I want to be a nomadic worker and travel the world with my wife someday.
